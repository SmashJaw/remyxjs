## Overview

Nx is configured as a lightweight layer on top of the existing npm workspaces monorepo. It provides:

- **Task orchestration** — Builds packages in dependency order (`@remyxjs/core` before `@remyxjs/react`)
- **Caching** — Skips unchanged builds, tests, and lints
- **Affected detection** — Only rebuilds/retests packages touched by a git diff
- **Release management** — Versioning, changelog generation, and npm publishing in one command
- **Dependency graph** — Visual dependency map of all packages

### Detected Projects

| Nx Project | npm Package | Targets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@remyxjs/core` | `@remyxjs/core` | build, dev, nx-release-publish |
| `@remyxjs/react` | `@remyxjs/react` | build, dev, nx-release-publish |
| `create-remyx` | `create-remyx` | nx-release-publish |

### Dependency Order

```
@remyxjs/core  →  @remyxjs/react
                create-remyx (independent)
```

`@remyxjs/react` depends on `@remyxjs/core`, so nx always builds core first. `create-remyx` has no build step and is independent.

---

## Setup

Nx is already installed. After cloning the repo, just run:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs nx and all plugins (`@nx/js`, `@nx/eslint`) as devDependencies.

To verify the setup:

```bash
npx nx show projects        # List all detected projects
npx nx show project @remyxjs/core  # Show targets for a project
```

---

## Building Packages

### Build All Packages

```bash
npm run build:all
# or directly:
npx nx run-many --target=build
```

Nx builds `@remyxjs/core` first (because `@remyxjs/react` depends on it), then `@remyxjs/react` in parallel if possible. `create-remyx` is skipped since it has no build target.

### Build a Single Package

```bash
npx nx run @remyxjs/core:build
npx nx run @remyxjs/react:build
```

Or use the shorthand:

```bash
npx nx build @remyxjs/core
npx nx build @remyxjs/react
```

When you build `@remyxjs/react`, nx automatically builds `@remyxjs/core` first if it's out of date (because of the `dependsOn: ["^build"]` configuration).

### Build Only Affected Packages

```bash
npm run affected:build
# or:
npx nx affected --target=build
```

This compares your current branch against `main` and only builds packages whose source files (or dependencies' source files) have changed. Useful in CI to avoid rebuilding everything.

You can change the comparison base:

```bash
# Compare against a specific commit
npx nx affected --target=build --base=abc123

# Compare against a specific branch
npx nx affected --target=build --base=develop

# Compare HEAD~1 (last commit)
npx nx affected --target=build --base=HEAD~1
```

---

## Versioning & Publishing

Nx release handles three steps: **version** (bump package.json versions), **changelog** (generate changelogs), and **publish** (push to npm registry).

### Prerequisites

Before publishing, ensure you are:
1. Logged into npm: `npm login`
2. A member of the `@remyxjs` npm organization: `npm access list collaborators @remyxjs/core`
3. On a clean git working tree (no uncommitted changes)
4. On the `main` branch (or your release branch)
5. All packages are built: `npm run build:all`

> **Note:** All `@remyxjs/*` scoped packages have `"publishConfig": { "access": "public" }` in their `package.json`, so they are published as public packages by default.

### Full Release (Version + Changelog + Publish)

```bash
npm run release
# or:
npx nx release
```

This runs all three steps interactively:

1. **Version** — Determines version bumps from conventional commits (or prompts you for a semver keyword)
2. **Changelog** — Generates/updates changelogs for each package and the workspace
3. **Publish** — Asks for confirmation, then publishes all packages to npm

You can also specify the version bump explicitly:

```bash
npx nx release patch    # 0.27.0 → 0.27.1
npx nx release minor    # 0.27.0 → 0.28.0
npx nx release major    # 0.27.0 → 1.0.0
```

### Dry Run a Release

Preview what would happen without making any changes:

```bash
npm run release:dry-run
# or:
npx nx release --dry-run
```

This shows you:
- What version each package would be bumped to
- What the changelog entries would look like
- What packages would be published

**Always dry-run before a real release.**

### Version Only

Bump versions in `package.json` files without publishing:

```bash
npm run release:version
# or:
npx nx release version
npx nx release version minor
npx nx release version 1.0.0   # exact version
```

This updates `package.json` version fields, commits the change, and creates git tags.

### Publish Only

Publish already-versioned packages to npm without bumping versions:

```bash
npm run release:publish
# or:
npx nx release publish
```

This runs `npm publish` for each package in the release configuration. Packages are published in dependency order (`@remyxjs/core` first).

### Publish a Single Package

```bash
npx nx run @remyxjs/core:nx-release-publish
npx nx run @remyxjs/react:nx-release-publish
npx nx run create-remyx:nx-release-publish
```

The `nx-release-publish` target automatically runs `build` first (configured in `dependsOn`).

### First Release

If this is the first time publishing (no existing versions on npm):

```bash
npx nx release --first-release
```

The `--first-release` flag tells nx:
- Don't look for previous git tags to determine the current version
- Don't check if the package already exists on the registry
- Use the version on disk as the starting point

### Prerelease Versions

```bash
# Create a beta prerelease
npx nx release prerelease --preid=beta
# 0.25.0 → 0.26.0-beta.0

# Create an alpha prerelease
npx nx release prerelease --preid=alpha
# 0.25.0 → 0.26.0-alpha.0

# Bump an existing prerelease
npx nx release prerelease
# 0.26.0-beta.0 → 0.26.0-beta.1
```

### Release a Subset of Projects

```bash
# Only release core
npx nx release --projects=@remyxjs/core

# Release core and react, skip create-remyx
npx nx release --projects=@remyxjs/core,@remyxjs/react
```

---

## Affected Commands

Nx can detect which packages are affected by your changes (compared to the `main` branch) and only run tasks for those:

```bash
# Build only affected packages
npm run affected:build
npx nx affected --target=build

# Test only affected packages
npm run affected:test
npx nx affected --target=test

# Lint only affected packages
npm run affected:lint
npx nx affected --target=lint

# Run multiple targets for affected packages
npx nx affected --targets=lint,build,test
```

Affected detection works by:
1. Computing a git diff between your branch and `main`
2. Mapping changed files to their owning project
3. Including all downstream dependents (e.g., changing `@remyxjs/core` also affects `@remyxjs/react`)

---

## Task Caching

### How Caching Works

Nx caches the output of `build`, `lint`, and `test` tasks. When you re-run a task and the inputs haven't changed, nx replays the cached output instead of running the task again.

**What determines cache hits:**
- Source files in the project (`{projectRoot}/**/*`)
- Source files in dependency projects (for `build` and `test`)
- Shared globals (root `package.json`)
- The task configuration itself

**What's excluded from cache inputs (production builds):**
- Test files (`*.test.js`, `*.spec.js`)
- Coverage directories
- ESLint config files

### Skip Cache

Force a fresh run, ignoring cached results:

```bash
npx nx run-many --target=build --skip-nx-cache
npx nx run @remyxjs/core:build --skip-nx-cache
```

### Reset Cache

Clear the entire cache:

```bash
npx nx reset
```

This removes all cached task outputs and the nx daemon state. Use this if you suspect cache corruption.

---

## Dependency Graph

Visualize the project dependency graph in your browser:

```bash
npm run graph
# or:
npx nx graph
```

This opens an interactive visualization showing:
- All projects and their relationships
- Which projects are affected by your changes
- Task pipeline execution order

You can also export the graph as JSON:

```bash
npx nx graph --file=graph.json
```

---

## Project Configuration

### nx.json Overview

The `nx.json` file at the repo root configures nx behavior:

```json
{
  "defaultBase": "main",
  "namedInputs": { ... },
  "targetDefaults": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],  // Build dependencies first
      "cache": true              // Cache build outputs
    },
    "nx-release-publish": {
      "dependsOn": ["build"]    // Build before publishing
    }
  },
  "release": {
    "projects": ["@remyxjs/core", "@remyxjs/react", "create-remyx"],
    "projectsRelationship": "independent",
    "version": { "conventionalCommits": true },
    "changelog": { ... },
    "git": { "commit": true, "tag": true }
  }
}
```

Key settings:

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `defaultBase` | `main` | Branch used for affected comparisons |
| `targetDefaults.build.dependsOn` | `["^build"]` | Build dependencies before the project |
| `targetDefaults.build.cache` | `true` | Enable build caching |
| `release.projectsRelationship` | `independent` | Packages can have different versions |
| `release.version.conventionalCommits` | `true` | Determine bumps from commit messages |
| `release.git.commit` | `true` | Auto-commit version bumps |
| `release.git.tag` | `true` | Auto-create git tags |

### Adding a New Package

When you add a new package to `packages/`:

1. Create the package directory with a `package.json`
2. Nx auto-detects it (no `project.json` needed)
3. Add it to the `release.projects` array in `nx.json` if it should be published
4. If it depends on other workspace packages, add them as dependencies in its `package.json` — nx infers the dependency graph

```bash
# Verify the new package is detected
npx nx show projects
npx nx show project my-new-package
```

---

## CI Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

Use affected commands in CI to only build/test what changed:

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Required for affected detection

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 22

      - run: npm ci

      # Only lint, build, and test affected packages
      - run: npx nx affected --target=lint
      - run: npx nx affected --target=build
      - run: npx nx affected --target=test
```

### Publishing from CI

The repo includes a ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/publish.yml`. It supports:

- **Manual dispatch** — Trigger from the GitHub Actions UI with version bump type, optional prerelease ID, dry-run mode, and first-release flag
- **Automatic builds** — Runs `nx run-many --target=build` before publishing
- **Git automation** — Commits version bumps and creates tags as `github-actions[bot]`

#### Setup

1. **Create an npm access token** — Go to [npmjs.com → Access Tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/~/tokens) and create a **Granular Access Token** with read/write permissions for the `@remyxjs` scope
2. **Add the token as a GitHub secret** — Go to your repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret → Name: `NPM_TOKEN`, Value: your token
3. **Trigger a release** — Go to Actions → "Publish to npm" → Run workflow → Select version bump type

#### Manual release from CI

```bash
# Go to GitHub → Actions → "Publish to npm" → Run workflow
# Select: patch | minor | major | premajor | preminor | prepatch | prerelease
```

#### Authentication

The `.npmrc` file at the repo root reads the `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable for authentication:

```
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
```

In CI, `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` is set from the GitHub secret. For local publishing, either export the environment variable or run `npm login` interactively.

The `--yes` flag in the workflow skips the interactive confirmation prompt, which is necessary in CI.

## Troubleshooting

### "Project not found"

```bash
npx nx show projects  # Verify the project name
```

Project names come from the `name` field in each `package.json`. Use the full scoped name: `@remyxjs/core`, not `remyx-core`.

### Cache producing stale results

```bash
npx nx reset          # Clear all caches
npx nx run-many --target=build --skip-nx-cache  # Rebuild without cache
```

### Build order wrong

Nx infers the dependency graph from `package.json` dependencies. Verify the graph:

```bash
npx nx graph
```

If `@remyxjs/react` doesn't depend on `@remyxjs/core` in its `package.json`, nx won't know to build core first.

### "Cannot publish — package already exists"

If a version is already published on npm, you can't re-publish it. Bump the version first:

```bash
npx nx release version patch
npx nx release publish
```

### Publish permissions

Make sure you're logged into npm and have publish permissions for the `@remyxjs` scope:

```bash
npm whoami
npm access list collaborators @remyxjs/core
```
