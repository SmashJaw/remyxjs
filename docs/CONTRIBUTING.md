## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18 or later
- **npm** 9 or later (ships with Node 18+)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/remyx-editor/remyx.git
cd remyx

# Install dependencies (npm workspaces will link all packages automatically)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The `npm install` at the repo root resolves all workspace dependencies, including the internal link between `@remyx/react` and `@remyx/core`. You do not need to run install inside individual packages.

---

## Project Structure

Remyx Editor is a monorepo managed with **npm workspaces**. All publishable packages live under `packages/`:

```
remyx/
  packages/
    remyx-core/        @remyx/core      0.24.0  Framework-agnostic editor engine
    remyx-react/       @remyx/react     0.24.0  React components and hooks
    create-remyx/      create-remyx     0.24.0  Reserved for future CLI tool
    docs/              (not published)           Documentation, changelog, roadmap
```

### @remyx/core

The core engine contains all editing logic and has zero framework dependencies:

```
packages/remyx-core/src/
  core/             EditorEngine, CommandRegistry, Selection, History, Sanitizer,
                    EventBus, KeyboardManager, Clipboard, DragDrop
  commands/         One file per command group (formatting, lists, tables, etc.)
  plugins/          Plugin system (createPlugin, PluginManager, built-in plugins)
  utils/            DOM helpers, paste cleaning, theme config, document converters
  constants/        Command names, keybindings, defaults, sanitization schema
  config/           defineConfig helper
  index.js          Public API re-exports
```

### @remyx/react

React bindings that wrap `@remyx/core`:

```
packages/remyx-react/src/
  components/       RemyxEditor, Toolbar, modals
  hooks/            useEditor, useSelection, useResolvedConfig, usePortalAttachment, etc.
  index.js          Public API re-exports
```

### create-remyx

Reserved for a future CLI tool. Project scaffolding has moved to `@remyx/react` — use `npx create-remyx-app`.

---

## Development Workflow

All commands are run from the **repository root** unless stated otherwise.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite dev server (root app with hot reload) |
| `npm run build` | Build the root app |
| `npm run build:core` | Build `@remyx/core` only |
| `npm run build:react` | Build `@remyx/react` only |
| `npm run build:all` | Build core then react (in dependency order) |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint across the entire repo |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally |

### Watch mode for packages

When working on a package in isolation, use the package-level `dev` script which runs Vite in watch mode:

```bash
cd packages/remyx-core
npm run dev    # vite build --watch
```

### Build order

Always build `@remyx/core` before `@remyx/react`, since React depends on Core. The `build:all` script handles this automatically.

### Testing

Jest is the unit test runner and Playwright handles end-to-end tests. Coverage reports are generated as HTML.

```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm test

# Run unit tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run unit tests with coverage report (output: coverage/unit/)
npm run test:coverage

# Run Playwright e2e tests (requires dev server)
npm run e2e

# View Playwright HTML report
npm run e2e:report
```

#### Test structure

| Directory | Runner | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/remyx-core/src/__tests__/` | Jest | Core engine, commands, plugins, utilities |
| `packages/remyx-react/src/__tests__/` | Jest | React hooks, components, config provider |
| `e2e/` | Playwright | Browser-based integration tests |

#### Writing tests

- One test file per module: `ModuleName.test.js` (or `.test.jsx` for React)
- Use `describe` / `it` nesting with `"should ..."` naming
- Use `jest.fn()` and `jest.spyOn()` for mocks
- Use `@testing-library/react` for component and hook tests
- Clean up DOM in `afterEach` when appending to `document.body`

### Linting

ESLint 9 is configured at the repo root with flat config. Run it before committing:

```bash
npm run lint
```

---

## How to Add New Commands

Commands are registered with the `CommandRegistry` and live in `packages/remyx-core/src/commands/`. Each file exports a registration function.

### 1. Create the command file

Create a new file in the commands directory, or add to an existing group file if the command fits logically.

```js
// packages/remyx-core/src/commands/highlight.js

/**
 * Register highlight commands with the editor engine.
 * @param {import('../core/EditorEngine.js').EditorEngine} engine
 */
export function registerHighlightCommands(engine) {
  engine.commands.register('highlight', {
    /**
     * Execute the command. Receives the engine instance and any
     * additional arguments passed to engine.commands.execute().
     */
    execute(engine, color = 'yellow') {
      document.execCommand('hiliteColor', false, color)
    },

    /** Return true when the command's state is currently active. */
    isActive() {
      return document.queryCommandState('hiliteColor')
    },

    /** Optional: return false to disable the command (grayed-out toolbar button). */
    isEnabled(engine) {
      return !engine.isMarkdownMode
    },

    /** Keyboard shortcut using "mod" for Ctrl (Windows/Linux) or Cmd (macOS). */
    shortcut: 'mod+shift+h',

    /** Metadata consumed by the toolbar renderer. */
    meta: { icon: 'highlight', tooltip: 'Highlight' },
  })
}
```

### 2. Register in EditorEngine

Import and call your registration function inside the `EditorEngine` constructor (or the command-bootstrapping section):

```js
import { registerHighlightCommands } from '../commands/highlight.js'

// Inside EditorEngine constructor or init:
registerHighlightCommands(this)
```

### 3. Export from the public API (if needed)

If the command should be available to consumers, re-export the constant name from `packages/remyx-core/src/constants/commands.js` and add it to `index.js`.

### Command API reference

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `execute` | `(engine, ...args) => any` | Yes | The action to perform |
| `isActive` | `(engine) => boolean` | No | Whether the command is currently active |
| `isEnabled` | `(engine) => boolean` | No | Whether the command can be executed |
| `shortcut` | `string` | No | Keybinding (e.g., `'mod+b'`) |
| `meta` | `object` | No | Toolbar metadata (`icon`, `tooltip`) |

## How to Create Plugins

Plugins extend the editor without modifying core source. Use the `createPlugin` factory from `@remyx/core`.

### Basic plugin

```js
import { createPlugin } from '@remyx/core'

export function MyPlugin() {
  return createPlugin({
    name: 'myPlugin',

    /**
     * Called when the plugin is initialized.
     * @param {object} api - Restricted plugin API facade
     */
    init(api) {
      api.eventBus.on('content:change', () => {
        console.log('Content changed')
      })
    },

    /** Called when the editor is destroyed. Clean up listeners, timers, etc. */
    destroy() {
      // teardown logic
    },
  })
}
```

### Plugin with commands and toolbar items

Plugins can register their own commands and contribute toolbar items, status bar items, and context menu items:

```js
import { createPlugin } from '@remyx/core'

export function EmojiPlugin() {
  return createPlugin({
    name: 'emoji',

    commands: [
      {
        name: 'insertEmoji',
        execute(engine, emoji) {
          document.execCommand('insertText', false, emoji)
        },
        meta: { icon: 'emoji', tooltip: 'Insert Emoji' },
      },
    ],

    toolbarItems: [
      { command: 'insertEmoji', group: 'insert' },
    ],

    statusBarItems: [],
    contextMenuItems: [],

    init(api) {
      // additional setup
    },

    destroy() {
      // cleanup
    },
  })
}
```

### Full engine access

By default, plugins receive a restricted API facade. If your plugin needs direct access to the DOM, sanitizer, or history, set `requiresFullAccess: true`:

```js
createPlugin({
  name: 'advancedPlugin',
  requiresFullAccess: true,
  init(engine) {
    // `engine` is the full EditorEngine instance
    engine.element.addEventListener('click', handleClick)
  },
  destroy() {
    // clean up direct DOM listeners
  },
})
```

Only use `requiresFullAccess` for trusted, first-party plugins. Third-party plugins should work within the facade API.

### Plugin definition properties

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | `string` | (required) | Unique plugin identifier |
| `init` | `(api) => void` | no-op | Initialization hook |
| `destroy` | `() => void` | no-op | Cleanup hook |
| `requiresFullAccess` | `boolean` | `false` | Receive full engine instead of facade |
| `commands` | `array` | `[]` | Commands to register |
| `toolbarItems` | `array` | `[]` | Toolbar button definitions |
| `statusBarItems` | `array` | `[]` | Status bar widget definitions |
| `contextMenuItems` | `array` | `[]` | Context menu entries |

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork and branch.** Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature main
   ```

2. **Make your changes.** Follow the code style guidelines below. Keep commits focused and atomic.

3. **Lint.** Ensure `npm run lint` passes with no errors.

4. **Build.** Run `npm run build:all` to verify both packages compile cleanly.

5. **Test.** Run any relevant tests. If you add new functionality, add tests to cover it.

6. **Update documentation.** If your change affects the public API, update the relevant docs in `packages/docs/`.

7. **Open a pull request** against the `main` branch. In your PR description:
   - Summarize what changed and why.
   - Reference any related issues (e.g., `Closes #42`).
   - Note any breaking changes.

8. **Review.** A maintainer will review your PR. Address feedback by pushing new commits (do not force-push during review).

9. **Merge.** Once approved, a maintainer will merge using squash-and-merge.

### What makes a good PR

- Solves one problem per PR. Split unrelated changes into separate PRs.
- Includes before/after screenshots for visual changes.
- Does not introduce linting errors or build warnings.
- Has a clear, descriptive title (see commit message conventions below).

---

## Code Style Guidelines

### Language

- **JavaScript with JSDoc.** All source files are `.js`. There are no TypeScript source files in the repo. Type information is provided through JSDoc annotations and separate `.d.ts` declaration files.
- **ES Modules.** All packages use `"type": "module"`. Use `import`/`export` syntax, not `require()`.

### Formatting

- No semicolons (the codebase omits them consistently).
- Single quotes for strings.
- Two-space indentation.
- Trailing commas in multiline constructs.

### JSDoc

Annotate all exported functions, classes, and non-trivial internal functions:

```js
/**
 * Register alignment commands with the editor engine.
 * @param {import('../core/EditorEngine.js').EditorEngine} engine
 */
export function registerAlignmentCommands(engine) {
  // ...
}
```

### React patterns

- **Functional components only.** No class components.
- **Hooks over HOCs.** Prefer custom hooks for reusable logic.
- **Named exports.** Avoid default exports for components and hooks.
- **`React.memo`** for components that receive stable props but whose parents re-render frequently.
- **`React.lazy` + `Suspense`** for heavy components like modals that are not needed on initial render.
- **New JSX transform.** Do not import `React` unless you use a React API (e.g., `React.memo`, `useState`). The JSX transform handles `createElement` automatically.

### File organization

- One command group per file in `commands/`.
- One plugin per file in `plugins/builtins/`.
- Co-locate React hooks with the components that use them when they are single-use. Extract to `hooks/` when shared.

### Constants

- Extract magic numbers into named constants in `constants/defaults.js`.
- Use `ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE` for constant values.

## Commit Message Conventions

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

<optional body>

<optional footer>
```

### Types

| Type | When to use |
|---|---|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace, semicolons (not CSS) |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `build` | Build system or dependency changes |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks (CI config, .gitignore, etc.) |

### Scope

Use the package short name: `core`, `react`, `create-remyx`, or `docs`. Omit the scope for cross-cutting changes.

### Examples

```
feat(core): add highlight command with keyboard shortcut
fix(react): prevent toolbar re-render on every keystroke
docs: add CONTRIBUTING.md
refactor(core): split documentConverter into per-format modules
build: upgrade Vite to 7.3.1
```

### Breaking changes

Add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit footer or append `!` after the type/scope:

```
refactor(core)!: rename EditorEngine.init() to EditorEngine.mount()

BREAKING CHANGE: Consumers calling `engine.init(element)` must update
to `engine.mount(element)`.
```
