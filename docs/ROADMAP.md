# Remyx Editor Roadmap

**Current Version:** 0.26.0
**Status:** Multi-package architecture complete (`@remyx/core` + `@remyx/react`), autosave with pluggable storage, command palette

A living document outlining planned features, improvements, and long-term direction for the Remyx rich-text editor.

---

## ~~Multi-Package Architecture~~ ✅ Shipped (v0.23.4)

- ~~Create `@remyx/react` with peer dependency on core~~ — 36 modules, full TypeScript declarations
- ~~Standalone `remyx-editor` package~~ — removed; consumers use `@remyx/react` directly
- ~~npm workspaces monorepo setup~~
- See [PLANNED_PACKAGES.md](./PLANNED_PACKAGES.md) for the full restructure plan

## ~~Autosave~~ ✅ Shipped (v0.26.0)

- ~~Periodic autosave to `localStorage` / `sessionStorage` with configurable interval~~
- ~~Crash-recovery banner: "Unsaved content was recovered — restore it?"~~
- ~~Server-side autosave~~ — implemented as pluggable storage providers (LocalStorage, SessionStorage, FileSystem, Cloud HTTP, Custom)
- ~~Debounced save on every content change with deduplication~~
- ~~Visual save-status indicator (Saved / Saving... / Unsaved)~~
- Cloud storage: AWS S3 presigned URLs, GCP signed URLs, any HTTP endpoint
- Filesystem provider for Node/Electron/Tauri apps
- `AutosaveManager` class + 5 storage providers in `@remyx/core`

- Column and row resize handles with drag support
- Cell merging and splitting
- Sortable columns (click header to sort ascending/descending)
- Filterable rows with a compact filter UI per column
- Cell formatting: number, currency, percentage, date
- Copy/paste between Remyx tables and external spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets)
- Freeze header row on scroll for large tables

## Code Block Syntax Highlighting

- Language-specific syntax highlighting inside fenced code blocks using a lightweight library (Prism, Shiki, or Highlight.js)
- Language selector dropdown on code blocks — pick from common languages (JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Bash, JSON, etc.)
- Auto-detect language from content when no language is specified
- Theme-aware highlighting — colors adapt to light/dark editor themes and custom theme presets
- Line numbers toggle per code block
- Copy-to-clipboard button on code blocks
- Markdown round-trip: preserve language identifiers (` ```js `, ` ```python `) in markdown output
- Lazy-loaded highlighting engine — syntax library only loaded when a code block is present
- Extensible language registry — consumers can add custom language grammars via plugin or prop
- Inline code spans with optional mini-highlighting for single-line snippets

## Expanded Plugin Architecture

- Formal `createPlugin()` lifecycle hooks: `onInit`, `onDestroy`, `onContentChange`, `onSelectionChange`
- Plugin dependency resolution and load ordering
- Scoped plugin settings with a per-plugin configuration schema
- Plugin marketplace/registry concept — discover and install community plugins
- First-party plugin packs: code editing, diagramming, math (LaTeX/KaTeX), footnotes
- Plugin sandboxing to prevent one plugin from breaking the editor or other plugins

## AI Integration

- `aiProvider` prop accepting an adapter interface for any LLM backend (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- Inline AI actions: rewrite selection, summarize, expand, translate, adjust tone
- AI-powered autocomplete with ghost-text suggestions (Tab to accept)
- Context-aware AI — sends surrounding content for better suggestions
- Slash-command menu (`/ai summarize`, `/ai translate to Spanish`, etc.)
- Privacy-first: no data sent anywhere unless the consumer explicitly configures a provider

## Spelling & Grammar Checking

- Built-in spellcheck layer using the browser's native `Intl` / spellcheck API
- Optional integration with LanguageTool, Grammarly SDK, or a custom grammar service
- Inline red/blue underlines with right-click correction suggestions
- "Ignore" and "Add to dictionary" per-session or persistent
- Language detection and multi-language support
- Grammar rule categories: punctuation, passive voice, wordiness, clichés
- Writing-style presets (formal, casual, technical, academic)

## Template System & Merge Tags

- Automatic WebP/AVIF conversion for supported browsers
- Lazy-loading for images below the fold (`loading="lazy"`)
- Responsive `srcset` generation from a single upload
- Video thumbnail extraction and poster frame selection
- Embedded video player with playback controls (not just raw `<video>`)
- Image editing toolbar: crop, rotate, brightness, contrast, filters
- Drag-to-resize with aspect ratio lock

## Service Integrations

- **Cloud storage**: Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive — browse and insert files/images directly
- **Media**: Unsplash, Pexels, Giphy — search and insert royalty-free images/GIFs
- **Embeds**: YouTube, Vimeo, Twitter/X, CodePen, Figma — rich embed previews
- **Collaboration**: Slack, Microsoft Teams — share editor content or receive webhook notifications
- **CMS**: WordPress, Contentful, Strapi, Sanity — bidirectional content sync
- **Email**: Mailchimp, SendGrid — export editor HTML as email-ready templates
- Integration SDK with a standardized adapter pattern for adding custom services

## Real-Time Collaborative Editing

- CRDT-based conflict-free real-time co-editing (Yjs or Automerge)
- Awareness protocol: live cursors with user names and colors
- Presence indicators showing who is currently viewing/editing
- Offline-first: queue changes locally, sync when reconnected
- Operation history with per-user attribution
- Configurable transport: WebSocket, WebRTC, or custom
- `collaborationProvider` prop — bring your own signaling server or use a hosted option

## Nx Monorepo Integration

- Migrate from npm workspaces to [Nx](https://nx.dev/) for monorepo orchestration
- **Task pipeline**: define `build`, `test`, and `lint` target dependencies so `@remyx/react` automatically builds `@remyx/core` first
- **Computation caching**: Nx caches build and test outputs locally — rebuilds only what changed
- **Remote caching**: enable Nx Cloud for shared CI/local cache across the team (optional, free tier available)
- **Affected commands**: `nx affected:build` and `nx affected:test` run only against packages touched by a PR, dramatically speeding up CI
- **Project graph**: `nx graph` visualizes package dependencies (`core` → `react` → `editor`) for onboarding and debugging
- **Generators**: scaffold new framework wrappers (`@remyx/vue`, `@remyx/svelte`, `@remyx/angular`) with consistent structure via Nx generators
- **Release management**: `nx release` for coordinated versioning, changelog generation, and npm publishing across all packages
- **Enforce module boundaries**: lint rules preventing `@remyx/core` from importing `react` or `@remyx/react` from importing framework-specific code it shouldn't
- **Parallel execution**: Nx runs independent targets in parallel with configurable concurrency, utilizing all CPU cores
- **Migration path**: incremental adoption — add `nx.json` and per-package `project.json` files without changing existing `package.json` scripts or Vite configs

## ~~Multiple Editor Instances~~ ✅ Shipped

- ~~Full instance isolation: each editor gets its own engine, history, and event bus~~
- ~~No DOM ID collisions — all selectors scoped to the editor root~~
- ~~Shared configuration via a `<RemyxConfigProvider>` context wrapper~~
- Inter-editor communication bus for linked editors (e.g., source + preview)
- Memory-efficient shared singleton for icons, sanitizer schema, and toolbar config
- ~~Stress-tested with 10+ concurrent editors on a single page~~

## ~~Menu Bar~~ ✅ Shipped

- ~~Application-style menus (File, Edit, View, Insert, Format) with submenus~~
- ~~Custom menu bar configuration with nested items and separators~~
- ~~Auto-deduplication: items in menu bar removed from toolbar~~
- ~~Keyboard navigation, hover-to-switch, escape-to-close~~
- ~~Dark/light/custom theme support~~

## Security Hardening

- Sanitizer: extend dangerous-protocol checking to `src`, `action`, `formaction`, and `data` attributes
- Sanitizer: domain allowlist for iframe `src` (YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion only)
- Sanitizer: explicit `on*` event handler blocklist as defense-in-depth
- Sanitizer: fully remove dangerous tags (`script`, `style`, `svg`, `math`, `form`, `object`, `embed`) instead of unwrapping
- Sanitizer: restrict `<input>` to `type="checkbox"` only
- Markdown parser: set `html: false` to block raw HTML injection
- URL protocol validation on `insertLink`, `insertImage`, and `window.open` calls
- Data URI validation: block `image/svg+xml` data URIs
- Iframe `sandbox` attribute on embedded media
- File size limits on pasted/dropped images (configurable, 10 MB default)
- Plugin sandboxing: restricted engine facade, prevent command overwriting
- CSP-compatible build: eliminate all `document.write`, `execCommand`, and inline style dependencies
- Subresource integrity (SRI) hashes for CDN-loaded assets (Google Fonts, external scripts)
- Fix `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` fallback logic in ImportDocumentModal
- See [TASKS.md](./TASKS.md) for the full audit report and remediation priorities

- Automated dependency updates (Renovate or Dependabot) with auto-merge for passing patch bumps

## Quality Improvements

- Comprehensive unit test suite (Vitest) for engine, commands, sanitizer, and converters
- End-to-end tests (Playwright) covering toolbar interactions, paste, drag-and-drop, and modals
- Visual regression tests for theme and layout stability
- Accessibility audit: full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, screen reader testing, keyboard navigation
- RTL (right-to-left) language support with `dir="rtl"` auto-detection
- Internationalization (i18n): externalized strings, locale packs, pluralization
- Improved undo/redo with operation coalescing (batch rapid keystrokes into a single undo step)
- Better large-document performance: virtualized rendering for 10k+ paragraph documents
- Print stylesheet for clean printed output
- Cross-browser testing matrix: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest 2 versions)
- Content Security Policy (CSP) compatibility — no inline styles or eval required
- XSS-hardened sanitizer with configurable allowlists and deny-by-default
- Graceful degradation: core editing works without JavaScript features like Web Workers
- Error boundaries: editor never crashes the host app — isolates and reports errors via `onError` callback
- Automated performance benchmarks: track keystroke latency, paste speed, and render time per release

## Performance Optimizations

- Tree-shakeable ESM build — import only what you use
- Code-split heavy features (PDF import, markdown, syntax highlighting) behind dynamic `import()`
- Reduce initial bundle size to < 50 KB gzipped for the core editor
- Memoized toolbar rendering — skip re-renders when selection state hasn't changed
- Batch DOM mutations with `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother typing
- Web Worker offloading for expensive operations (sanitization, markdown parsing, document conversion)
- Profiled and optimized hot paths: keystroke handling, selection polling, content serialization
- Lighthouse performance score target: 95+
- Incremental DOM diffing: only re-render changed portions of the document tree
- Idle-time processing: defer non-critical work (word count, readability scores) to `requestIdleCallback`
- Memory pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects (selections, ranges, format state)
- Virtualized rendering for long documents: only mount visible blocks in the DOM
- Lazy plugin loading: plugins initialize on first use, not on editor mount
- Compressed undo history: store diffs instead of full snapshots to reduce memory usage
- Input batching: coalesce rapid keystrokes into single DOM updates to eliminate layout thrash
