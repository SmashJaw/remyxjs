# Planned — P0: Security & Stability

These items protect users from XSS, data loss, and crashes. They should be addressed before any new feature work.

## Security Hardening — ✅ Mostly Shipped (v0.24.0), remaining items open

- ~~Sanitizer: extend dangerous-protocol checking to `src`, `action`, `formaction`, and `data` attributes~~
- Sanitizer: domain allowlist for iframe `src` (YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion only)
- ~~Sanitizer: explicit `on*` event handler blocklist as defense-in-depth~~
- ~~Sanitizer: fully remove dangerous tags (`script`, `style`, `svg`, `math`, `form`, `object`, `embed`) instead of unwrapping~~
- ~~Sanitizer: restrict `<input>` to `type="checkbox"` only~~
- ~~Markdown parser: set `html: false` to block raw HTML injection~~
- ~~URL protocol validation on `insertLink`, `insertImage`, and `window.open` calls~~
- ~~Data URI validation: block `image/svg+xml` data URIs~~
- Block external SVG URL insertion (`.svg` URLs can contain embedded scripts)
- Percent-encoded protocol bypass hardening in modal URL validators
- SourceModal re-sanitization before applying user-edited HTML
- CloudProvider endpoint URL validation to prevent injection
- Export PDF iframe `sandbox` attribute
- URL validation via `URL` constructor instead of regex where possible
- ~~Iframe `sandbox` attribute on embedded media~~
- ~~File size limits on pasted/dropped images (configurable, 10 MB default)~~
- ~~Plugin sandboxing: restricted engine facade, prevent command overwriting~~
- CSP-compatible build: eliminate all `document.write`, `execCommand`, and inline style dependencies
- Subresource integrity (SRI) hashes for CDN-loaded assets (Google Fonts, external scripts)
- ~~Fix `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` fallback logic in ImportDocumentModal~~
- See [TASKS.md](./TASKS.md) for the full audit report (42 security items, 33 resolved, 9 open)

## Quality Improvements

- ~~Comprehensive unit test suite (Jest) for engine, commands, sanitizer, and converters~~ — 1251 tests across 49 files
- ~~End-to-end tests (Playwright)~~ — Removed; the repo does not serve a production web server. Will revisit when a hosted demo is available.
- XSS-specific test coverage for all modal components (LinkModal, ImageModal, SourceModal, etc.)
- Visual regression tests for theme and layout stability
- ~~Accessibility: WAI-ARIA menu pattern, focus trapping, skip navigation, `baseHeadingLevel`~~
- RTL (right-to-left) language support with `dir="rtl"` auto-detection
- Internationalization (i18n): externalized strings, locale packs, pluralization
- Improved undo/redo with operation coalescing (batch rapid keystrokes into a single undo step)
- Better large-document performance: virtualized rendering for 10k+ paragraph documents
- Print stylesheet for clean printed output
- Cross-browser testing matrix: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest 2 versions)
- ~~XSS-hardened sanitizer with configurable allowlists and deny-by-default~~
- ~~Error boundaries: `EditorErrorBoundary` wraps the editor, `onError` callback for error reporting~~
- Automated performance benchmarks: track keystroke latency, paste speed, and render time per release

## Performance Optimizations

- ~~Tree-shakeable ESM build — import only what you use~~
- ~~Code-split heavy features (PDF import, DOCX, document converters) behind dynamic `import()`~~
- ~~Memoized toolbar rendering — `React.memo` + `shallowEqual` bail-out on selection state~~
- ~~Terser minification with `drop_console` and `drop_debugger`~~
- ~~Lazy-loaded modals — all 9 modals deferred via `React.lazy` (~20–30 KB)~~
- ~~PDF/DOCX opt-in — `mammoth` and `pdfjs-dist` as optional peer deps~~
- Reduce initial bundle size to < 50 KB gzipped for the core editor
- Batch DOM mutations with `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother typing
- Web Worker offloading for expensive operations (sanitization, markdown parsing, document conversion)
- Lighthouse performance score target: 95+
- Idle-time processing: defer non-critical work (word count, readability scores) to `requestIdleCallback`
- Virtualized rendering for long documents: only mount visible blocks in the DOM
- Lazy plugin loading: plugins initialize on first use, not on editor mount
- Compressed undo history: store diffs instead of full snapshots to reduce memory usage
- Input batching: coalesce rapid keystrokes into single DOM updates to eliminate layout thrash
- See [TASKS.md](./TASKS.md) for the full optimization inventory (59 items, 21 complete)

## Build & DevOps

- ~~Nx monorepo integration — task orchestration, caching, affected commands~~
- ~~GitHub Actions CI pipeline: build → lint → test on every push/PR~~
- Automated npm publishing via `nx release` on tagged commits
- ~~Pre-commit hooks (Husky + lint-staged) for consistent code quality~~
- Bundle size tracking: fail CI if any package exceeds its size budget
- Automated dependency updates (Renovate or Dependabot) with auto-merge for passing patch bumps

## create-remyx CLI

Interactive CLI tools for scaffolding Remyx Editor projects.

### `create-remyx-app` — ✅ Shipped (v0.25.0, enhanced v0.27.0)

Quick project scaffolding via `npx create-remyx-app`:

- ~~Project name prompt~~
- ~~Language: JavaScript (JSX) or TypeScript (TSX)~~
- ~~Theme selection: Light, Dark, Ocean, Forest, Sunset, Rose~~ (v0.27.0)
- ~~Optional PDF/DOCX import (mammoth + pdfjs-dist)~~
- ~~Vite-based project with `@remyxjs/core` + `@remyxjs/react`~~
- ~~Post-scaffold instructions: install, dev, build~~

### `create-remyx` — Planned (advanced wizard)

Full-featured interactive wizard via `npx create-remyx`:

- Pick a framework: React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, or Vanilla JS
- Choose features: toolbar layout, menu bar, status bar, floating toolbar, context menu
- Select plugins: word count, autolink, placeholder, code highlighting, math, comments
- Configure theme with live preview of theme variables
- Pick document formats: HTML output, Markdown output, or both
- Optional add-ons: image upload handler scaffold, collaboration stub
- Output a `remyx.config.js` (or `.ts`) with the full `defineConfig()` setup
- Template variants: minimal (bare editor), standard (toolbar + status bar), full-featured (all UI chrome)
- Plugin authoring mode: `npx create-remyx --plugin` scaffolds a plugin package with `createPlugin()` boilerplate, test setup, and build config

## Nx Monorepo Integration

- Migrate from npm workspaces to [Nx](https://nx.dev/) for monorepo orchestration
- **Task pipeline**: define `build`, `test`, and `lint` target dependencies so `@remyxjs/react` automatically builds `@remyxjs/core` first
- **Computation caching**: Nx caches build and test outputs locally — rebuilds only what changed
- **Remote caching**: enable Nx Cloud for shared CI/local cache across the team (optional, free tier available)
- **Affected commands**: `nx affected:build` and `nx affected:test` run only against packages touched by a PR, dramatically speeding up CI
- **Project graph**: `nx graph` visualizes package dependencies (`core` → `react` → `editor`) for onboarding and debugging
- **Generators**: scaffold new framework wrappers (`@remyxjs/vue`, `@remyxjs/svelte`, `@remyxjs/angular`) with consistent structure via Nx generators
- **Release management**: `nx release` for coordinated versioning, changelog generation, and npm publishing across all packages
- **Enforce module boundaries**: lint rules preventing `@remyxjs/core` from importing `react` or `@remyxjs/react` from importing framework-specific code it shouldn't
- **Parallel execution**: Nx runs independent targets in parallel with configurable concurrency, utilizing all CPU cores
- **Migration path**: incremental adoption — add `nx.json` and per-package `project.json` files without changing existing `package.json` scripts or Vite configs

## External Configuration

- Load toolbar layout, theme, fonts, and plugin list from a JSON/YAML config file
- `RemyxEditor.fromConfig(url)` static method for fully declarative setup
- Environment-based config merging (development vs. production defaults)
- Admin panel concept: a standalone UI for building editor configurations visually
- Runtime config reloading without unmounting the editor
