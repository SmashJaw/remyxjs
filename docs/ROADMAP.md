# Remyx Editor Roadmap

**Current Version:** 1.3.0-beta
**Status:** Multi-package architecture complete (`@remyxjs/core` + `@remyxjs/react`), config-file-only architecture (RemyxEditor accepts config prop), drag-and-drop plugin system (remyxjs/plugins/), theme externalization (remyxjs/themes/), 5 config presets, unified 6-theme system, autosave, command palette with recently-used pinning and custom command registration, code block syntax highlighting, enhanced tables, security hardening, inter-editor communication, RTL/i18n/print with BiDi-aware caret movement, block-based editing with type conversion/templates/grouping, mobile & touch optimization, comments & annotations with inline threads/mentions/panel/comment-only mode, expanded plugin architecture with dependency resolution/lifecycle hooks/scoped settings/registry, callouts/alerts/admonitions, template system with merge tags/conditionals/loops, keyboard-first editing with Vim/Emacs/auto-pair/multi-cursor, drag-and-drop content, advanced link management, math/equation editor, table of contents/document outline, content analytics/readability, real-time collaboration, UX/UI improvements (animations, empty state, distraction-free mode, breadcrumb bar, minimap, split view, sticky toolbar, toolbar customization, color presets, typography controls), spelling & grammar checking with writing-style presets, performance optimizations (WorkerPool, VirtualScroller, compressed undo history, input batching, lazy plugin loading, shared selectionchange listener, getHTML caching, hash-based sanitizer LRU), comprehensive code audit with 50 bug fixes, P0 complete, 275/275 tasks resolved, 1768 tests passing

A living document outlining planned features, improvements, and long-term direction for the Remyx rich-text editor. Sections are ordered by priority — security and stability first, then features ranked by user impact.

# Planned

## Demos & Playwright Testing

A `demos/` directory with self-contained examples and end-to-end Playwright tests, all runnable from within the packages repo.

- **Demo apps**: standalone examples for each major feature (tables, collaboration, math, comments, templates, etc.) with minimal boilerplate
- **Playwright E2E tests**: browser-based tests covering real user interactions — typing, formatting, drag-and-drop, plugin behavior, toolbar/menu interactions
- **Test runner integration**: `npm run test:e2e` script in `packages/package.json`, executable via `npx playwright test` from `demos/`
- **CI integration**: Playwright tests run in the GitHub Actions CI pipeline alongside unit tests
- **Visual regression**: optional screenshot comparison for toolbar, theme, and layout consistency
- **Accessibility audits**: automated axe-core checks on each demo page
- **Documentation**: each demo serves as living documentation — users can reference the source as usage examples

## Plugin & Theme Repository

A community-driven repository hosted on [remyxjs.com](https://remyxjs.com) for discovering, sharing, and installing user-made plugins and themes.

- **Plugin registry**: browse, search, and install community plugins directly from the editor config or CLI
- **Theme gallery**: browse and preview user-submitted themes with live demos; one-click install via config file or `customTheme` prop
- **Publishing workflow**: `npx remyx publish` CLI command to package and submit a plugin or theme to the registry with metadata (name, version, description, author, tags, screenshots)
- **Versioning & compatibility**: semver-based versioning with `@remyxjs/core` compatibility ranges; registry enforces minimum core version
- **Quality checks**: automated validation on submission — lint, bundle size check, security scan (no eval, no external network calls), basic smoke test
- **Rating & reviews**: community ratings and usage statistics to surface popular/trusted plugins
- **Scoped packages**: plugins published as `@remyxjs-community/plugin-name` on npm for easy installation; themes as JSON files downloadable from the gallery
- **SDK**: `createPlugin()` and `createTheme()` APIs already exist; add a plugin template scaffold for quick authoring
- **Integration with `resolvePlugins`**: registered community plugins can be referenced by name in JSON/YAML config files (e.g., `"plugins": ["@community/kanban-board"]`)

## Version History & Diffing

- Named snapshots: save the current document state with a label
- Visual diff view: side-by-side or inline diff between any two snapshots
- Restore to any previous snapshot with one click
- `onSnapshot` callback for server-side persistence
- Auto-snapshot on major operations (paste, bulk delete, import)
- Change attribution: track which user made which changes (pairs with collaboration)

## Image & Video Optimization

- Client-side image compression before upload (configurable quality/max dimensions)
- Automatic WebP/AVIF conversion for supported browsers
- Lazy-loading for images below the fold (`loading="lazy"`)
- Responsive `srcset` generation from a single upload
- Video thumbnail extraction and poster frame selection
- Embedded video player with playback controls (not just raw `<video>`)
- Image editing toolbar: crop, rotate, brightness, contrast, filters
- Drag-to-resize with aspect ratio lock

## Framework Wrappers & CMS Integrations

| Framework | Status | Package |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **React** | ✅ Available | `@remyxjs/react` |
| **Core (framework-agnostic)** | ✅ Available | `@remyxjs/core` |
| **Vanilla JS / Web Component** | Planned (P0 — CMS packages depend on this) | `@remyxjs/vanilla` |
| **Vue 3** | Planned | `@remyxjs/vue` |
| **Svelte 5** | Planned | `@remyxjs/svelte` |
| **Angular** | Planned | `@remyxjs/angular` |
| **Node.js (SSR)** | Planned | `@remyxjs/ssr` |

| **Ghost** | Planned | `ghost-remyx` — Koenig editor replacement |
| **Shopify** | Planned | `@remyxjs/shopify` — Liquid-compatible rich text for theme/app extensions |

- Shared core engine across all framework wrappers
- Framework-specific bindings for reactivity, lifecycle, and two-way data binding
- Web Component wrapper (`<remyx-editor>`) for framework-agnostic embedding
- CMS integrations use `@remyxjs/vanilla` (Web Component) for framework-agnostic drop-in

## Nx Monorepo — Remaining

- **Remote caching**: enable Nx Cloud for shared CI/local cache across the team (optional, free tier available) — not yet configured; add `nxCloudAccessToken` to `nx.json` when ready
- **Generators**: scaffold new framework wrappers (`@remyxjs/vue`, `@remyxjs/svelte`, `@remyxjs/angular`) with consistent structure via Nx generators — deferred until framework wrappers are built

## Lighthouse Performance Target

- Lighthouse performance score target: 95+ — requires a hosted demo page; infrastructure ready, will validate when demo site is deployed

## Custom Theme Builder

- Contrast checker: validate text/background color combinations against WCAG AA/AAA — will be integrated into the remyxjs.com theme builder

- ~~Migrate from npm workspaces to [Nx](https://nx.dev/) for monorepo orchestration~~ — `nx.json` configured alongside existing npm workspaces (incremental adoption)
- ~~**Task pipeline**: define `build`, `test`, and `lint` target dependencies so `@remyxjs/react` automatically builds `@remyxjs/core` first~~ — `dependsOn: ["^build"]` in `targetDefaults`
- ~~**Computation caching**: Nx caches build and test outputs locally — rebuilds only what changed~~ — `cache: true` for build, lint, and test targets
- **Remote caching**: enable Nx Cloud for shared CI/local cache across the team (optional, free tier available) — not yet configured; add `nxCloudAccessToken` to `nx.json` when ready
- ~~**Affected commands**: `nx affected:build` and `nx affected:test` run only against packages touched by a PR, dramatically speeding up CI~~ — `npm run affected:build`, `affected:test`, `affected:lint` scripts; CI workflow uses affected commands
- ~~**Project graph**: `nx graph` visualizes package dependencies (`core` → `react`) for onboarding and debugging~~ — `npm run graph`
- **Generators**: scaffold new framework wrappers (`@remyxjs/vue`, `@remyxjs/svelte`, `@remyxjs/angular`) with consistent structure via Nx generators — deferred until framework wrappers are built

Errors logged to console and emitted as `plugin:error` events with `{ name, error, hook }` payload. A crashing plugin cannot affect other plugins or the editor.
- ~~Plugin metadata: `version`, `description`, `author` fields for registry/marketplace discovery~~
- ~~32 new unit tests for lifecycle hooks, dependency resolution, settings validation, registry, and metadata~~

- ~~Lazy plugin loading: plugins initialize on first use, not on editor mount~~ — `lazy: true` in plugin definitions skips `initAll()`, initializes on first command execution via wrapped handlers; `activatePlugin(name)` for explicit activation
- ~~Compressed undo history: store diffs instead of full snapshots to reduce memory usage~~ — character-level common-prefix/suffix diffing for documents over 5000 chars; full snapshots for short documents; `_resolveEntry()` walks backward to nearest full snapshot and applies diffs forward
- ~~Input batching: coalesce rapid keystrokes into single DOM updates to eliminate layout thrash~~ — `createInputBatcher()` with `queue()`, `flush()`, `destroy()` methods using rAF coalescing
